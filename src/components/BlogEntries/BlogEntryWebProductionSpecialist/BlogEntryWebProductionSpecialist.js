            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">In short, a Web Production Specialist at Thrillworks is a 'Jack of all trades' role with focus on: Content authoring, email campaigns, web production graphics, and front-end web development.</p>
            {/* Finish Intro */}
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Below are examples of various tasks and methods that were required of my position on a day-to-day basis.</p>

            {/* Agile Methodology */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Agile Methodology</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Agile methodology is a very different approach to project workflow. It allows work to adapt as the scope changes, enables rapid development, increases overall quality, productivity, team visibility, and profitability.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">A brief synopsis of&nbsp;Agile:</p>
            <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <li>No more departments. Teams are created to handle specific clients. These teams include the skillsets that cover the needs of the&nbsp;client.</li>
              <li>A new workflow process in-which a project is broken down into bite sized pieces of work, and marked with level of effort estimates. All of the pieces of work are put up on a board, prioritised and categorized by their status: Backlog, in progress, blocked, ready for review or completed. Code development is done in weekly or bi-weekly sprints which usually end with a demo. There are daily stand-up meetings to catch everyone up on the work that was done yesterday, what is being worked on today, and if there are any&nbsp;blockers.</li>
              <li>Retrospectives meetings are scheduled to help iron out issues that came up throughout a project. This helps improve upon processes for the next&nbsp;time.</li>
              <li>Employees are T-shaped, meaning that they are encouraged to help out when they can, even if it is a different workflow or technology that they are not used to. This helps ensure minimal knowledge silos and that teams share the&nbsp;workload.</li>
            </ul>

            {/* Front-End Web Development */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Front-End Web Development</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Front-End Web Development involves creating or modifying websites with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and PHP. When working on a Front-End project, typically it includes many of the tasks in 'Content Authoring', but can also&nbsp;include:</p>
            <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <li>Creating/Pulling a code repository onto my computer, and using source control to manage the&nbsp;project.</li>
              <li>Using a front-end framework and HTML, SCSS, JS and PHP to develop web&nbsp;projects.</li>
              <li>Collaborating with other developers, ensuring code standards are met and that there are no code conflicts in the&nbsp;repository.</li>
              <li>Promoting project work onto a testing environment and providing testing URLs. Once approved, promoting the work to the live production environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" />

            {/* Content Authoring */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Content Authoring</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">As a Web Production Specialist I authored web pages, created and manipulated templates, components, content and assets using various content management systems. The technologies I used most often were Adobe&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;Manager, Open Text's RedDot, WordPress, SiteCore and&nbsp;Magento.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">The tasks I performed would&nbsp;include:</p>
            <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <li>Creating and building new web pages based on provided copy decks, spreadsheets and&nbsp;designs.</li>
              <li>Modifying existing web&nbsp;pages.</li>
              <li>Creating and managing multi-lingual versions of web&nbsp;pages.</li>
              <li>Managing and hooking up digital assets (images, videos,&nbsp;documents).</li>
              <li>Managing products, promotional banners and press&nbsp;releases.</li>
              <li>Promoting pages through workflow from Author to Staging, and from Staging to&nbsp;Production.</li>
              <li>Versioning pages, backing up files and managing page&nbsp;data.</li>
              <li>Setting up analytics, meta-data and page&nbsp;re-directs.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" />

            {/* Email Campaigns */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Email Campaigns</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Using technologies like Foundation for Sites, Exact Target and MailChimp, I built, tested and deployed .html and .txt email&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Typical Process:</p>
            <ol>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I am provided .PSDs of approved emails. I slice out the images that I need and save them out as web graphics with specific naming&nbsp;conventions.</li>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I upload all of the sliced images to the email client and note their final URLs and dimensions so I can rapidly add images to the .html later&nbsp;on.</li>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I copy a pre-existing email with the structure that is closest to what I need. Typically the header and footer stay the same as a pre-existing email so copying is more expedient to the&nbsp;process.</li>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I strip down the copied emails (.html and .txt) and keep only the structure that will be required for the&nbsp;build.</li>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">I build out the emails by referencing any spreadsheets, copydecks and designs that have been provided. This is when I add all of the images, analytics, alt text, links, and&nbsp;copy.</li>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">When done, I upload the .html and .txt files to the email client and send test emails to myself and internal leadership for review. Then there is a feedback loop, first internally, then with the&nbsp;client.</li>
              <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">When all emails are ready to be sent there can be some additional criteria to be met. That can&nbsp;involve:
                <ul>
                  <li>Setting up a scheduled deployment in batches (e.g. 15,000/hr) to account for server load on popular&nbsp;campaigns.</li>
                  <li>Partitioning subscribers for region specific&nbsp;campaigns.</li>
                  <li>Hooking up dynamically generated content (e.g. QR&nbsp;Codes).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" />

            {/* Web Production Graphics */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Web Production Graphics</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Using photo-editing software, primarily Adobe Photoshop; Manipulate designs and output images to work with the needs of a project. This can&nbsp;include:</p>
            <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <li>Slicing and saving out optimized images in various file types and&nbsp;dimensions.</li>
              <li>Updating fonts, copy, colour, UIs and&nbsp;graphics.</li>
              <li>Translating content and modifying&nbsp;products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">You are typically provided finished designs and it is your job to ensure all graphics are ready for production. If there is re-work required on a design or asset, it is typically on the Web Production Specialists' to make&nbsp;adjustments.</p>

            <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" />      

            {/* Ticket Tracking */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Ticket Tracking</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Once a deliverable has been sent for review, any issues that have been spotted are turned into tasks using software like JIRA. We use this ticket process to ensure all issues are tracked, marked for their importance, and eventually resolved. This gives everyone oversight on the project, its status and the amount of work left to&nbsp;do.</p>

            <hr data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" />

            {/* Training Documentation */}
            <h2 class="h3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Training Documentation</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">If a new process is developed, or if a client/internal staff require training on a process, we create detailed training documentation. This includes a step-by-step document with both a visual and textual representation of the process. In the document we include as many relevant resources and examples as&nbsp;possible.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">Internal documentation at Thrillworks is created as a Wiki. Documents to clients are provided in the format that they are requested in, typically designed&nbsp;PDFs.</p>
